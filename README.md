# the-gallery-42

HI, MY NAME IS STEPHANO DIEGO. SINCE A CHILD I HAVE BEEN IN LOVE WITH STREET ART, HAVE A HUGE ADMIRATION FOR THE CULTURAL MOVEMENT AND ARTISTS.
IN 2018 I STARTED MY FIRST COLLECTION AND TODAY IT HAS BECOME A HOBBY.
THE -— GALLERY 42 ® IS MY PROJECT FOR BUYING, SELLING AND EXHIBITING.
THE PROJECT AIMS TO PROMOTE ACCESS TO ARTISTS' WORK AND ALSO PROVIDE AN DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE FROM TRADITIONAL ART GALLERIES.

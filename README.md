# THE — GALLERY 42

Hi, my name is Stephano Diego. Since a child i have been in love with street art, have a huge admiration for the cultural movement and artists.
In 2018 i started my first collection and today it has become a hobby.

The — Gallery 42 ® is my project for buying, selling and exhibiting.
The project aims to promote access to artists' work and also provide an different experience from traditional art galleries.
